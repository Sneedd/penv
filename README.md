penv Framework
====
The acronym penv stands for project environment. The framework
itself was designed to create software which needs a project, window,
event and package management. The framework is not designed to create
a project management software, but it is also possible to set up such a
software with this framework. Instead the framework was designed to
create applications which needs to organize projects, their files and
the various windows to edit these files. Possible applications can be
an IDE, Text Editors, Uml Designer and so on. Especially for scientific
applications this framework can be advantageous.

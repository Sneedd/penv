/**
 * \mainpage penv Framework.
 * The acronym penv stands for project environment. The framework
 * itself was designed to create software which needs a project, window,
 * event and package management. The framework is not designed to create
 * a project management software, but it is also possible to set up such a
 * software with this framework. Instead the framework was designed to
 * create applications which needs to organize projects, their files and
 * the various windows to edit these files. Possible applications can be
 * an IDE, Text Editors, Uml Designer and so on. Especially for scientific
 * applications this framework can be advantageous.<br><br>
